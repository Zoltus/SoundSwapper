# Sound Swapper
Allows the user to replace any sound named in the wiki sounds list: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/List_of_in-game_sound_IDs

To replace a sound, add its name to the list in the plugin menu, then place a .wav file with the same name in your root
RuneLite folder. The plugin will grab the sound and use it instead!

E.g. *firebolt_hit* -> place *firebolt_hit.wav* in your RuneLite folder
